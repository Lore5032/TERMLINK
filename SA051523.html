I will not yield.\nAs I pen these words in the early morning hours, I am reminded of the sacrifices made, the lives lost in our pursuit of justice. It is a heavy burden to bear, and sometimes I must force myself to remember every detail of the battles fought. But I must remain resolute, fueled by the hope that this city can be redeemed.

Using my undercover identity as The Knight, I infiltrated Black Tusk's base and placed a server cloning tool amidst their server stacks. With access to their systems, I navigated the virtual labyrinth, extracting valuable information. But the files I stumbled upon surpassed anything I had anticipated. Secrets, machinations, and sinister plots that extended far beyond my jurisdiction.\n In our audacity, we publicized the evidence we had uncovered. Black Tusk, sensing their vulnerability, resorted to hiring hitmen to eliminate both me and Nick. The ensuing battle was fierce, a symphony of violence and survival. We fought tooth and nail against the relentless onslaught, and in the end, we emerged victorious. However, victory came at a great cost. Nick and Leo Imamura, the acting head of Black Tusk, fell in the line of duty.";
